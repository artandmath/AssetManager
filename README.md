# AssetManager
Asset Manager is a panel for Nuke that pulls the assets (ie.e nodes that have a 'file' knob) into rows in a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet allows the modification of values which are in turn written back to the 'file' knob of the node. The spreadsheet columns are determined by a one line schema string of tokens that describes the structure of the filesystem.
> [!CAUTION]
> Asset Manager is in a pre-release/protoype stage and is not intended for production use in its current state.

## Installation

Download Qt.py and add into your .nuke folder or PYTHON_PATH:
https://github.com/mottosso/Qt.py

Download the AssetManager folder and add into your .nuke folder or PYTHON_PATH.

Add to your menu.py:

```python
from nukescripts import panels

"""Asset Manager"""
def getAssetManagerWidget():
    from AssetManager import view as AssetManagerView
    return AssetManagerView.AssetManagerWidget()

panels.registerWidgetAsPanel(
    'getAssetManagerWidget',
    'Asset Manager',
    'com.danielharkness.AssetManager',
    False
)
```
Open AssetManager in Nuke from Windows:Custom:Asset Manager.

Hover cursor over the first text field for syntax to build a schema that matches your filesystem.

Open the AssetManagerDemo.nk nukescript for syntax examples.

To disable color on the tokens and to disable the override field above the tokens, add the following environment variables with empty stirngs:
```bash
#! /bin/bash
#add these lines to your environment
ASSET_MANAGER_ENABLE_OVERRIDE=""
ASSET_MANAGER_ENABLE_COLOR=""
```

## Project Goals/Principals
- A schema syntax that can describe _MOST_ VFX filesystem schemas using a single line of text.
- A library that can use that schema for file IO in any DCC.
- Keep it simple. Simple enough for a non-VFX systems admin or technical artist to set up and manage, not so complicated that it requires a software developer or TD(s).
- Interoperable with OpenAsset I.
- Work in filesystem only mode if the database has failed, or as a stepping stone to developing a database. And without any filesytem breadcrumbs.
- Solve/Desolve system.
- Asset Importer.
- Asset Manager.
- If the project needs to capture edge cases, consider whether that's the right way to do it.
- Always remain pipeline independant.
- Filesystem/Database level only. Any item on disk for which Nuke has a node that contains a 'file' knob. What is contained inside an asset/file is outside the scope of the project.

## Investigations

- Shims between Asset Manager & SG Tank/Toolkit, Pyblish etc

## Todo - long term
- Revisit schema/token syntax, allow for some more flexibility and syntax that enables restrictions per token.
- Project roadmap
- Ground up re-write: using the Nuke panel Asset Manager prototype as a guide.
- Hooks/extensible for non-core functionality. eg - color code versions, group via file/token, contextual right-click, version to latest, version to current, non-token spreadhseet columns, thumbnails, row highlighting for errored/missing files etc etc.

## Known issues with prototype
- Any cell can be updated when we really only want to update items within one column.
- For example, click a row, modify a cell, evey token is written and you've killed your asset.
- Undo is performed with a sledgehammer. It's Apple Shake level stable.
- Pieces of code from node_table are still littered in the prototype. The comments within the code will likely be incorrect.
- Probably won't work with Microsoft Windows.
- Won't work with url paths "smb://" etc 

## Special thanks
- Thank you to Mitja MÃ¼ller-Jend for his node_table panel for Nuke. Your code is some of the most readable I've ever encountered: https://gitlab.com/filmkorn/nuke_node_table
- I apologize for basterdizing it to hack together this prototype.
